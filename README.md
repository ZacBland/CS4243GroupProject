From Vamsi Lakshman Varma Datla

I have taken Brennan's code which is server and client connection and integrated it with my code of reading and displaying options.txt. It worked fine

Commands to run my code:

gcc -w Vamsi_Varma_Server.c
./a.out

Parallelly run the below commands on the other terminal.

gcc -w Vamsi_Varma_Client.c
./a.out

Now on Client side it will display options and now select the required option.

from Bhanu Teja Solipeta

I have pushed the integrated code from server to client connection until reading the column names from the selected file and tested it. It worked fine

Commands to run the code:

gcc -w Bhanu_Server.c
./a.out

also run the below commands on client side
gcc -w Bhanu_Client.c
./a.out

After selecting a file options corresponding to the file are shown below

From Blake: 
to run process.c:
-use csx1

-enter the following commands:
gcc process.c
./a.out

-follow the prompts, it is case sensitive.
