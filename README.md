From Vamsi Lakshman Varma Datla

I have taken Brennan's code which is server and client connection and integrated it with my code of reading and displaying options.txt. It worked fine

Commands to run my code:

gcc -w Vamsi_Varma_Server.c
./a.out

Parallelly run the below commands on the other terminal.

gcc -w Vamsi_Varma_Client.c
./a.out

Now on Client side it will display options and now select the required option.
